**Epidemiology and outcome of candida blood stream infections in cancer patients, a comparative retrospective study**

*Background*: 
Candida blood stream infections (BSI) in cancer patients are an important source of morbidity and mortality. While the widespread use of antifungal prophylaxis has led to a decline in the overall incidence, insights about the clinical course, risk factors and outcomes of candida blood stream infections are important. Moreover, direct comparisons of risk factors and outcomes of candida BSI to bacterial BSI are lacking. 

*Methods*: In this single-center, comparative retrospective study conducted	in a tertiary cancer center in Germany, we compared outcomes of 29 candida BSI events to 608 bacterial BSI events in a study population of 403 patients mainly with hematological cancers. Furthermore, we identified risk factors and therapy sequence in candida BSI.  

*Results*: Patients with candida BSI had a significantly poorer 30 day overall survival (HR 4.5, 95% CI 2.5 – 8.1, p <0.001) compared to bacterial BSI events. When stratified for bacterial taxonomy and drug resistance, mortality with candida BSI ranked second after that with bacterial BSI with multi-drug resistant gram-negative organisms with carbapenem resistance (MDRGNO + CR, univariate HR for 30 day OS 8.1, 95% CI 4.3 – 15.3, p < 0.001). Candida BSI events were exclusively nosocomial and occurred most frequently in patients undergoing palliative treatment for relapsed or refractory disease.     

*Conclusion*: When compared to bacterial BSI events, candida BSI carry significant 30 day mortality and occur predominantly in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory disease.
